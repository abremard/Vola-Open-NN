    This project needs TickData (either TickWrite or TickWriteWeb) to run, please contact the owner of the project to obtain access.

    Important setups include :
    1) install TickWrite client
    2) creating a TickWrite schedule daily on week days that runs 2 separate TickWrite jobs:
        - one for tick data fetch, refresh new data for network training
        - one for time data fetch, required for next day success forecast
    3) On Windows, create task that runs SCHEDULE.PY using Task Scheduler, please refer to this tutorial
